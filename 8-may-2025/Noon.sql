 -- 1) List all orders with the customer name and the employee who handled the order.
--(Join Orders, Customers, and Employees)

select OrderID , CompanyName as Customer , concat(FirstName,' ',LastName) Employee_Name from orders o
join Customers c on o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID 
join Employees e on o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID

--2) Get a list of products along with their category and supplier name.
--(Join Products, Categories, and Suppliers)

select * from products
select ProductName ,CategoryName, CompanyName from products p
join Categories c on p.CategoryID = c.CategoryID 
join Suppliers s on s.SupplierID =p.SupplierID

--3) Show all orders and the products included in each order with quantity and unit price.
--(Join Orders, Order Details, Products)
select * from [Order Details]
select ProductName,o.*,od.UnitPrice,Quantity,Discount from [Order Details] od
join Products p on p.ProductID= od.ProductID 
join Orders o on o.OrderID = od.OrderID

--4) List employees who report to other employees (manager-subordinate relationship).
--(Self join on Employees)

select * from Employees;
select concat(e.FirstName,' ',e.LastName) as Employee , concat(m.FirstName,' ',m.LastName) as Manager  from Employees e
join Employees m on e.ReportsTo =m.EmployeeID;

--5) Display each customer and their total order count.
--(Join Customers and Orders, then GROUP BY)

--15) Use a CTE with recursion to display employee hierarchy.

--Start from top-level employee (ReportsTo IS NULL) and drill down

WITH EmployeeHierarchy AS (

    SELECT 
        EmployeeID,
        concat(FirstName,' ' ,LastName) EmployeeName,
        ReportsTo,
        0 AS Level
    FROM Employees
    WHERE ReportsTo IS NULL

    UNION ALL

    SELECT 
        e.EmployeeID,
        concat(e.FirstName,' ' ,e.LastName) EmployeeName,
        e.ReportsTo,
        eh.Level + 1
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.ReportsTo = eh.EmployeeID
